# Get all subreddit images

***RedditImageCrawler*** ia a tool to automatically retrieve images from any given subreddit.

It was created because a friend kept asking for bowsette pics and i am powered by lazyness.

(That also means that the default subreddit is the /r/bowsette, so it most certainly contains NSFW imagery, use with caution)

$ npm install redditimagecrawler
```
